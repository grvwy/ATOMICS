//! One browser channel to a host through a rendezvous broker: the Noise handshake that opens it, the
//! pairing exchange when this device pairs, and `atomics.v1` frames sealed and opened on it
//! (docs/daemon.md, "Pairing and the encrypted channel"). Sans I/O: it takes the broker's binary
//! messages and gives back those to send, so the same code runs in the browser and in tests against
//! a host built from `atomics_core::noise`.
