//! The frame's life with one host, sans I/O: the boot, the encrypted channel through the broker, pairing,
//! `atomics.v1` into the [`RemoteBackend`], and reconnecting with a fresh ticket from the hosting page.
//! The browser glue (`web.rs`) carries out its [`Output`]s and feeds back what happened; the tests drive
//! it against a host built from `atomics_core`, with no browser.
//!
//! Reconnecting: when the channel drops, the driver waits (jittered, 1 s doubling to 30 s), asks the
//! hosting page for a fresh ticket ([`boot::WANTS_TICKET`]), dials again, and resumes with `hello`'s
//! prior epoch and cursor, so the host replays what was missed or sends a snapshot.
//!
//! A native client reaches its host directly instead ([`Driver::direct`]): on this machine, or through a
//! forward to another one, with no broker, ticket or Noise channel. The upgrade's bearer token is the
//! authentication, and the glue finds the address and token afresh for every dial
//! ([`Output::DialDirect`]), so a host that restarted with a new token is reached again.
//!
//! A browser whose frame storage lasts only while it runs keeps a sealed copy of the key on the hosting page
//! ([`crate::keep`]): after a pairing the driver asks for it to be kept before it says `atomics.paired`, and a cold
//! start that finds this frame's store empty but the page's copy there waits on a tap to unlock it
//! ([`Stop::Locked`]). Elsewhere nothing changes: no passkey is asked for, and the frame's store is the key's home.
//!
//! What it trusts: close codes and anything else outside the encrypted channel come through the
//! broker unauthenticated. So the stored key is forgotten only on the host's refusal sealed into the
//! channel (`wire::not_paired`); a bare `not_paired` close stops the frame but keeps the key. Only a
//! failed handshake answer says the host's key differs; a transport message that fails ends the
//! channel and the frame dials again.
